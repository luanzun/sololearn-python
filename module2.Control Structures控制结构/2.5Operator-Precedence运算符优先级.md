# 运算符优先级
## 运算符优先级
** Operator precedence** is a very important concept in programming. <br>
**运算符优先级**是编程中非常重要的一个概念。

It is an extension of the mathematical idea of order of operations (multiplication being performed before addition, etc.) to include other operators, such as those in Boolean logic. <br>
它是操作顺序（加法之前需执行乘法等）的数学思想的扩展，包括其它运算符，例如布尔逻辑中的运算符。

The below code shows that == has a higher precedence than or:
以下代码显示， **==** 运算符的优先级高于 **or** ： 

## 运算符优先级
下表列出了所有的 Python 的运算符，从最高优先级到最低优先级。
Operator                 | Description
--------                 | -----------
**                       | Exponentiation (raise to the power)
~ + -                    | Complement, unary plus and minus (method names for the last two are +@ and -@)
* / % //                 | Multiply, divide, modulo and floor division
+ -                      | Additon and subtraction
>> <<                    | Right and left bitwise shift
&                        | Btiwise 'AND'
^ |                      | Bitwise exclusivve 'OR' and regular 'OR'
<= < > >=                | Comparison operators
<> == !=                 | Equality operators
= %= /= //= -= += *= **= | Assignment operators
is,is not                | Identity operators
in, not in               | Menbership operators
not, or, and             | Logical operators
